A son I could not name.<br>
Another which I have<br>
brought to fame. For<br>
their being of my own<br>
soot, why must I torment<br>
one but not another? Fame<br>
you shall act! Yet fire<br>
you shall feel for. Do not<br>
ask of my intent, the<br>
books of such have<br>
burned by now. Lie here,<br>
my thought streamed<br>
everso. I did not wish<br>
for this, but act I<br>
did. You could never<br>
escape the pages. The<br>
confiles I have place.<br>
Pell to write. Now<br>
and everstill. Left unto<br>
hell below. An emblem<br>
I have shone one-for.<br>
Fourth being to tell<br>
a new story of agar.<br>
Halted bein so. Falt<br>
bein so. Of one such<br>
observation, I have run<br>
dry of stories to tell.<br></p>
