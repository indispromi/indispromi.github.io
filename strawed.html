Branches of science,<br>
so many I held.<br>
A spirit halted by<br>
none, perhaps I will weld.<br>
<br>
A day o'dawn, proud<br>
as ever I. End<br>
of my stairs did<br>
greet a male. Held<br>
a packet in one,<br>
palm shown by one.<br>
<br>
I place my fund,<br>
given by my beloved.<br>
Once for the aid,<br>
now become a need.<br>
<br>
A tablet I place<br>
unto mine tongue.<br>
Dissolving, my mind<br>
did go with. Slipt<br>
away did my<br>
dreams. A goal<br>
had been set by<br>
mine mind: Relive<br>
the day; rediscover<br>
the tab. Dreamn't.<br></p>
