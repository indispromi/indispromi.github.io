A boy I did meet,<br>
there in those<br>
woods one day.<br>
A boy pure. A boy<br>
free of strife.<br>
He shown me his<br>
grateful wooden<br>
sword, full of life.<br>
Oh how life did<br>
love such a boy,<br>
and life he loved<br>
right back.<br>
<br>
Alas, was time<br>
for the boy to<br>
go. He wander<br>
back, mighty sword<br>
held proudly above.<br>
<br>
One day, I became<br>
one much too<br>
curious. Find that<br>
boy in a forum,<br>
his parents there<br>
they mourn. A poor<br>
boy has died. He<br>
was lost to suicide.<br></p>
