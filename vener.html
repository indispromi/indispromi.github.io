Falling, man do find<br>
his final minute. Doyost,<br>
a train of many thoughts.<br>
<br>
As you fall thru the<br>
state of yourself, find<br>
an outlier. An outlier I<br>
of many could never. The<br>
readings change with<br>
the pressure. Leaving is<br>
to become summed negate.<br>
A way through and<br>
between. A spiraling<br>
script none would stand<br>
for, but you. Neither<br>
deal fits a vision held<br>
by you. For such, revolt.<br>
Style is constructed thru<br>
path bested.<br>
<br>
Windowed ellipses. I lack<br>
the phy of one who<br>
becomes their own<br>
sanctionary. A full stop<br>
erased by welcoming.<br>
Obligations meant to<br>
strife, now lie in destel.<br></p>
