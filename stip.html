A confliction I beg catch sight of<br>
less, for it drains my being everso.<br>
Dear lord, why must they hurt eachother?<br>
They know it is not their own fault,<br>
right? Lord above, you would not do such<br>
a thing. You would not! Imposing of bills<br>
we shant be slading to begin of such!<br>
Why have the hours gone by,<br>
but for I haven't still made<br>
of my realization? Is<br>
this who we are<br>
meant to<br>
become?<br></p>
