Thorned to divinity,<br>
all up above, lied.<br>
To mine holy trinity:<br>
Sins of mine against humanity.<br>
<br>
Sing of me! Sing of mine!<br>
All are into the wooden.<br>
Heard from once a vine:<br>
A crucel against the divine.<br>
<br>
My once wife, lay dead here.<br>
In the shack hidden away.<br>
To whom I call my dear.<br>
To whom I call my dear.<br>
<br>
Forgive me, for I have kept,<br>
those of readings you lay.<br>
Nay, the lord has wept.<br>
Tears into a storm unkempt.<br>
<br>
He who watches now,<br>
he has seen. The cask,<br>
mine of ire, lay my vow.<br>
This evil, I am unsure how.<br>
<br>
God refuses to meet<br>
me, he is ashamed such.<br></p>
