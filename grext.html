Librarian stand hunched.<br>
Grasp in palm a<br>
riddle intras. She held<br>
sight. The riddle tore,<br>
burrowed. Spoke to<br>
her in the nigh. What<br>
is the answer? Who is<br>
the figure? A riddle<br>
she clutches. Rows and<br>
columns she searches.<br>
Book by book. Page<br>
by page. None hold<br>
her resolve. A lost<br>
direction. A derailed<br>
life. Oh how her riddle<br>
does breathe.<br>
<br>
Night fall. A story soon<br>
to end. She does climb<br>
up the spire. Climb to<br>
the top of her library<br>
roof. There she did<br>
stand, note in hand.<br>
Jumping. Falling. Unto<br>
the depths below.<br>
"I am the answer."<br>
Her lungs pull in. Impact.<br></p>
