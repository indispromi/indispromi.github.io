All past now,<br>
for I have seen.<br>
Seen him, unsure how.<br>
Has wiped my mind clean.<br>
<br>
An encounter, tell.<br>
Visited by them from hell.<br>
What lie for me,<br>
of spacial could not be.<br>
<br>
Abstractions I see.<br>
These below noth hurt.<br>
How many to be?<br>
Lest, lie here in dirt.<br>
Taken aback, to a tee.<br>
In that room, find me.<br>
<br>
I stare, not to hell.<br>
I stare, not to heaven.<br>
Nothing to fear, or to dwell.<br>
Chanting aside their eer spell.<br>
<br>
My friends had left<br>
me in the wooded<br>
cupboard. They of<br>
evil, hoping a<br>
spirit to poss mine.<br></p>
