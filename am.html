So as to their cask, now,<br>
take it all out on yours.<br>
Here. I am faced. I see<br>
thru and towards, I turn<br>
inanimate. Do not see yours<br>
desked support. I shall remove<br>

of fears. I shall kill you now. You<br>
do it for me, for I can not wield.<br>
Before so write another page. Go<br>

of pages. Write it for me, but you<br>
