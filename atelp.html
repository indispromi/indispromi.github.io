It was not your own<br>
fault. None of you are<br>
to blame. A cruel god<br>
did this to us. A god<br>
did this to us.<br>
<br>
You can not pray to<br>
control the weather; He<br>
will not give away such<br>
powers. He is a cruel god.<br>
<br>
You can not relive the<br>
past; He will not let you.<br>
He is a cruel god.<br>
<br>
You can not revive Dad;<br>
He spoke stern, so our god<br>
did strike him down.<br>
<br>
Strike him down, for he<br>
is a cruel god.<br></p>
