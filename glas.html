Sleep. Sleep forth.<br>
Forget our promise.<br>
Nay, I should have<br>
expected. The alcol<br>
makes you make<br>
you damned. It<br>
has ruined you, so<br>
have I. Such for<br>
of then, you have<br>
ruined me. Taken<br>
your advantage, moment<br>
of which I hate. Nez,<br>
memoir of which I<br>
crave restlessly. Do it<br>
again to me. Now I<br>
wish for it. So do it.<br>
<br>
You won't. You think you<br>
and I have changed oh<br>
so greatly. You wouldn't<br>
know but of the<br>
first. We are insept,<br>
do forth now. Pursue<br>
me once more, I<br>
shall deny, decline<br>
deny, decline, only to<br>
dream for it once more.<br></p>
