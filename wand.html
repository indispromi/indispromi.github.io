A cut has been made.<br>
It is not his fault.<br>
A mere soul of mine it<br>
is. I grew into comfort.<br>
<br>
Oh fun I had planned,<br>
proposal I had made.<br>
Whistle to a one he<br>
liked, I thought he<br>
had loved.<br>
<br>
Betrayal for a prel he<br>
should have cared. My<br>
son do cry for absence.<br>
I wish him no harm to<br>
become. I could not<br>
hurt him. I could not.<br></p>
