Crashing inside this home, it woke me.<br>
Some one person inside, but I am late.<br>
I confront the lady- oh so bone-ridden and<br>
frail she. Outside here we stand forth.<br>
Fragile as she, a gun in-hand right. That<br>
gun, mine who it belongs, but she holds it.<br>
Left hand of hers clutches a memory<br>
beign to myself. My sweetest boy, oh how<br>
he used to play. My sweetest boy, oh<br>
how I miss you in the called moon's light.<br>
Worry not, for I shall be with you soon.<br>
We shall meet once more. Play in the<br>
fields once more. I could not ask for<br>
one fate greater; rejoin my spirit to my<br>
son.<br>
<br>
I run. Scream. I scream to her. Make her<br>
heart lept with fear. Pull that trigger.<br>
Go forth, you must.<br>
<br>
I crash into her. My gun is empty. My<br>
opour is ruined. The one next door has<br>
informed the flashing lights of the trust,<br>
though I wish he had not.<br>
<br>
I wake once more. My son lie next<br>
to me, sleeping at peace. Sweet dreams.<br></p>
