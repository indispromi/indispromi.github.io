Much too earlie tied in<br>
for a letter. You dest aime,<br>
you never did change forth.<br>
The worm of inev ript thru<br>
mine of lining, for I hear<br>
it grumble my name. Plans<br>
aligned cons thrown stones<br>
down a hole flooded. Pained<br>
erosions of many i'ne feel<br>
worse everthorn. Doth yield<br>
above entered again via cast<br>
shadows of ire. I am none<br>
of pained, starving. Lie here<br>
into a ves of plade clothing,<br>
sat atop man's work as<br>
I enter into this world<br>
navint by means unknown.<br>
Yourself does crave such, so<br>
I peptal. You and I not<br>
sos of differences nay.<br>
Old friend begin new, for<br>
I too belten dest changes.<br>
Only differing internal spirit.<br>
Guide yours to new ligh'.<br>
<br>
Find me by that cabin<br>
again. My bride has been killed.<br></p>
