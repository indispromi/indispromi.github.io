For of he who knows mine of name, for<br>
my loc, for my face. Regrets of many for<br>
I have sinned. Sin I have veiled unto inno,<br>
I now hold emp. I have of change, him<br>
of not. Unwaning to reveal to masses, nay<br>
say he incons. Inunderstanding he. Paranoia<br>
of one. I was evil before. May the<br>
brigs of my past come to haunt, I shall<br>
escape to another of mine.<br>
<br>
Souls of yours close, oh be<br>
damned. It is not<br>
my fault. You must<br>
forget my<br>
name.<br></p>
