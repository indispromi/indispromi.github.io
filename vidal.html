Hell is to come of<br>
your people soon. Matter<br>
of, the names of<br>
whom I am inabled to<br>
reveal. I wishn't to,<br>
but I am forced<br>
to warn of such. The<br>
bells will toll atoned,<br>
and he will arrive.<br>
Nay hell itself, for<br>
he is mere a catal<br>
for many. Many to<br>
come. Many whom<br>
inhabit thus. One sole<br>
creator he, the cause<br>
of. He who I must<br>
never name. Though I<br>
am one of creators,<br>
I am one of created.<br>
<br>
He has been to lands<br>
o'yours atime before,<br>
but killed there he<br>
was. Vengeance he now<br>
do seek. Be wary of<br>
the bright. Be wary of<br>
the dim. I am one of his.<br></p>
