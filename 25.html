A creation of mine.<br>
Oh god this is in<br>
whole and in truth.<br>
A terrible, terrible day.<br>
An argument to be<br>
held oh GOD why!? Why<br>
am I so capable? I<br>
lie here. I lie here<br>
gun to my skull. Killed<br>
are both of my precious.<br>
Killed is my wife. Killed<br>
is mine own daughter. Oh<br>
for fucks sake. Her cries echo<br>
throughout all my mind. Deviled<br>
her before death. My own<br>
bringing. My own hell. The gun<br>
o'mine held none, and so I<br>
flee. By car, I end in a<br>
ditch to the side. Help is here.<br>
An individual who mustn't know.<br>
A tune created by my creator plays<br>
as I run into those woods. Intid,<br>
for I am shot by end's meet.<br>
After such a blanc, here I lay.<br>
One has found me, he know of<br>
my fate. Hell and plague I have<br>
brought unto this earth. Do not pray for me.<br></p>
