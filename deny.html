Why has it, must it,<br>
all come down to this?<br>
<br>
It will be of 28th.<br>
I will kill two of<br>
my own creation. I<br>
will attempt to create<br>
such a scene similar<br>
for my own, but I<br>
will fail greatly. A<br>
hard brake.<br>
<br>
The slowing down of<br>
mine. Come to a halt,<br>
screeching. The pole in<br>
front. I have changed<br>
much too late. Now,<br>
I am taken away.<br>
The happy cheer of one.<br>
The angered brow of one.<br>
I am to become of<br>
them. They have not been<br>
destroyed.<br>
<br>
|YOU TOLD ME, ON CERTA|<br>
|THAT DAY, THAT I|<br>
|WOULD BE FORGIVEN FOR|<br>
|MY SINS. I AM|<br>
|DAMNED.|<br></p>
