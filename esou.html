Hell becomes of<br>
you soon oh so<br>
soon. I desire<br>
this, do not<br>
change. The sine<br>
doth tell of mine<br>
own expr. Back<br>
to the lack of<br>
one. My friends<br>
they have betrayed<br>
me! Not enough.<br>
Never enough.<br>
Show them the<br>
greatest of pasts<br>
I have completely<br>
obliterated. Look<br>
at my work,<br>
damned, foul<br>
creation of god.<br>
These signs you<br>
bestow, lie in<br>
front of your own<br>
home. They have<br>
been written in a<br>
language none can<br>
know. It is the<br>
language of your cell. -Sal<br></p>
