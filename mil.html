For the masses,<br>
please. For the<br>
family of your own,<br>
please. Give us a<br>
sign. We have treats<br>
aplenty to satiate your<br>
dying hunger. A sweet<br>
bottle of orange, the ext<br>
of nature. It all lie posse<br>
against that spire. Below<br>
the colorful balloons. It<br>
is one, two, three of your<br>
idols, brought to life in<br>
plast. Ignore the screams<br>
of our flight above. We wish<br>
that it didn't scare you so.<br>
The weapons up high, those are<br>
not for you. Two large rockets<br>
parallel are for enemies o'ours.<br>
The inside is of safety, meant<br>
for you! Please, just follow<br>
the lights we have shone for<br>
you. We ████ miss the laughter<br>
everso, your departure has left<br>
us shambled. We ████ outcast by<br>
god. Do ignore the warned teachings<br>
heed, we are unfit to lose of youth.<br></p>
