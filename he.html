God is coming. God is<br>
coming. God is coming.<br>
God is coming. God is<br>
here. God is here. God<br>
is here. God is here.<br>
<br>
God yells for me. He<br>
wails behind. I am<br>
unable to reach him.<br>
He is behind me. He is<br>
before. Please God, just<br>
face me. Stop shouting.<br>
<br>
God wails. Sins too lon't.<br>
For I am incurable. Killed<br>
of many his. Why did I<br>
do this.<br>
<br>
I turn. God floats. Eyes<br>
unfocus. Jaw to drop. Take<br>
mine away. God, you<br>
must kill me now. Kill<br>
me now.<br>
<br>
Trapped in forest, I stare<br>
to God. He float still.<br>
Vision to black, I am taken.<br></p>
