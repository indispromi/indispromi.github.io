Day stood here, all my rage.<br>
Of my sancts, none could cure bore.<br>
Some to seat, some lack age.<br>
Her spirit being placed in cage.<br>
<br>
Outside my home, lies a door.<br>
For without, I hear their nage.<br>
I hear their calls, that I am a whore.<br>
My new gun here, lie under the floor.<br>
<br>
Last resort, I wishn't to engage.<br>
The screams do grow evermore.<br>
This home shall be my stage.<br>
A spectre, blast in ten gauge.<br>
<br>
My day, oh who is it for?<br>
Bodies lie, from one rampage.<br>
An act which shook my core,<br>
so why is it that I crave more.<br></p>
