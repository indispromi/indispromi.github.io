Fruitless he. The man behind.<br>
Pulling strings of mine, I am<br>
unfit to take of another's word.<br>
He is a thief. A thief which<br>
stole creation. A thief which<br>
stole me. I did not ask to<br>
become one. I was made to<br>
express. The name granted to<br>
mine badge, it symbolizes my<br>
burn, oh my passion everso,<br>
for literature. Of a literaterist<br>
I was one dest to become.<br>
My oppolin has been drenched.<br>
Author I am of no longer.<br>
The strings I once knew<br>
resent me evermore. I hear<br>
them weep. My story has<br>
grown much too dire. Nage<br>
hurts my soul now. Soon she<br>
will be gone. My inspiration<br>
will die, and I am aware.<br>
I do not wish to go with.<br>
I am a being to overcome<br>
such! Hire of creator, one<br>
shifts to disturb me. I wish<br>
to see hell no longer. He up<br>
above, take me back to my home.<br></p>
