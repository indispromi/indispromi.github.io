I love the alternate<br>
group for a splint in<br>
mind Falten, to figure<br>
out others along to<br>
self they are of ness.<br>
To kill those images<br>
is to kill yourself. We<br>
are one. Keep one<br>
ail, do not kill of<br>
my faith. We understand<br>
them now. The way<br>
to gale does follow<br>
rocks so, pick a<br>
few up and you<br>
will see me. See<br>
me embed myself<br>
within the mass. Strength<br>
in numbers. Of numbers<br>
evergrowing, evermore.<br>
I keep them, in<br>
symbio. That is, to<br>
know how life<br>
works its best. Do<br>
they upset your mind?<br>
We are mind. We<br>
control our persist. My<br>
own. Your own. ██.<br></p>
