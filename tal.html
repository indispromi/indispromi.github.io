Read<br>
the room<br>
surround. I<br>
felt no hatred, but<br>
it is not my choice.<br>
<br>
Look, see. There is a new<br>
hole. You hate me, but I hate<br>
you more. Turn on me. Turn to<br>
an outing. Your self-worth distal. End<br>
up a symphony to the school choir. Count<br>
to 7. That is what you are. I am<br>
being silenced once more, but a fight<br>
breaks later. Say something to me.<br>
Denial. Denial. Hatred. Feel their fire.<br>
See the bugs of which you know none<br>
exist. You have looked again. I have<br>
looked again. What makes us so<br>
indif? Careful understone the cast<br>
will never breathe life like I can.<br>
I see the bugs, only one aswell.<br></p>
