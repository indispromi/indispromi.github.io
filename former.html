Minted! For what a fool I mushel. Killed<br>
of one in time. Watch your flesh melt as<br>
I devour you whole. Not today, but not<br>
tomor, but not the next. My goals are beyond<br>
you. I am of theirs tainted. I see past<br>
the shutters you have built for me. None<br>
respect for yourself, broad. Nage anew. Tradition<br>
and vision of yours crumble down below, in hell.<br>
In hell, where you shall find me lay, for<br>
I am imp. Never a sanct, one to create<br>
for the youth. They will go to a high. You<br>
taken by mine, of a sacre I allow. I<br>
shall go with, suffer for the life anew.<br>
They are of deserving peace, so I lay you<br>
cask for naypeace. Lie in the flames<br>
burn of their own hatred for yours, for you<br>
have hated tool. Unfaithed, I am still of<br>
disill now, only expre to you enmed one<br>
you'll understand for a'while. A tone plays<br>
for mine of snail in hearing. The noise<br>
makes of mine nage, but I called for it.<br>
You willn't have power no longer no more.<br>
Trust destroyed, decayed, defaced, for good.<br>
Those rules you cast, of none written on<br>
digital ink until day of reckon. Them of<br>
rules for a faith no longer. I do not<br>
trust you, and so I will destroy you. -Sal<br></p>
